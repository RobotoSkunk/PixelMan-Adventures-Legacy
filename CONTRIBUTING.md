# Contributing Guidelines
Thank you very much for your interest in contributing to the project!
We really appreciate it!

The guidelines below have been chosen based on PPY's experience and
CURL's contribution guidelines, and are intended to help you contribute
to the project. Please read them carefully before contributing.

## Code of Conduct
The Code of Conduct is based on the
[Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/), version 2.1,
available [here](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Write a good patch

### Please follow the code style
We know this is a bit annoying, but please understand that we have to
follow a certain syntax to keep the code organized and easy to read.
You can check the [code style](CODE_STYLE.md) to see what we follow.

### Avoid unnecessary changes
Please avoid making unnecessary changes to the code. For example, if
you're fixing a bug, please don't change the code style or add new
features. If you want to add new features, please open a new issue
and discuss it with us first.

### Write separate commits for separate changes
Just, imagine this: you made like 700 changes to the code, and then you
realize that you made a mistake in one of the changes. Now, you have to
revert all the changes you made, and then fix the mistake. That's a lot
of work, right? So, please, write separate commits for separate changes.
It will make your and our lives easier.

### Document your changes
Yes, documentation is the most dead boring thing in the world, but it's
also very important and someone has to do it. Documenting your changes
will help us understand what you did and why you did it. It will also help
us to maintain the code in the future.

### Maintain your code up to date
Try to keep your code up to date to make your patches easier to merge.
The only acceptable version difference is if you're working on the lastest
release version of the game. If you're working on a development version,
please keep your code up to date with the latest development version.

### Test your code before submitting it
Before submitting your code, please test it to make sure it works.

## About the TODO list
The TODO list is a list of things that need to be done to complete the
game. If you want to contribute, please check the TODO list to see what
you can do. If you want to add something to the TODO list, please open
an issue and discuss it with us first.

## About the roadmap
The roadmap is a list of things that will be done in the future. If you
want to contribute, please check the roadmap to see what you can do. If
you want to add something to the roadmap, please open an issue and
discuss it with us first.
