# LEGACY VERSION, NO LONGER MAINTAINED
This is a legacy version of PixelMan Adventures, it's no longer maintained and
it's here just for historical reasons. If you want to see the new version, go
to the [Godot version repository](https://github.com/RobotoSkunk/PixelMan-Adventures).

## Do you want to revive this project?
I'm not working on this project anymore in favor of the new
[Godot version](https://github.com/RobotoSkunk/PixelMan-Adventures), but if you
want to revive it, feel free to do so. I'll be happy to see what you can do
with it.
